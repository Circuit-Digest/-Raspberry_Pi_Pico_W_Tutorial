Today, we will explore how to build a real-time web server using a Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller and a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor. By combining the power of Raspberry Pi Pico's microcontroller capabilities and the DHT11 sensor's ability to measure temperature and humidity, we can create a simple yet effective system for monitoring environmental conditions. We will walk through the process of setting up the hardware, writing the code, and creating a web server that displays the temperature and humidity data in real-time.
